Question 3: What is the purpose of the label element in a form, and how does it improve accessibility?

Answer : The <label> element in HTML is used to associate a descriptive label with a form control (e.g., <input>, <textarea>, <select>). Its primary purpose is to provide users clear description of each form control, which improves accessibility and usability including those using assistive technologies, 

How label Improves Accessibility

For Screen Reader Users:
Labels help screen reader users understand what data to enter into a form. When a user focuses on a form input, the screen reader will read out the associated label. 

For Users with Mobility Challenges:
By Clicking the label it focuses on the associated form element, making it easier to interact with small or hard-to-click elements like checkboxes.

For Visual Clarity:
Labels help clarify the purpose of form controls, thus reducing user errors.
