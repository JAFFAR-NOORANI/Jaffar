ï‚· Question 1: Define HTML. What is the purpose of HTML in web development?


**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is used to create the structure and content of a web page. It is the backbone of a
web page, providing the basic framework for how elements are displayed in a browser. HTML is used to
define headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, tables, lists, and other elements that make
up a web page

### **Purpose of HTML in Web Development**


1. **Content Structuring:** HTML organizes web content into headings, paragraphs, lists, and other structures,
    making it comprehensible to both users and search engines.

2. **Foundation for Websites:** HTML is the backbone of any website. Other technologies like CSS (for styling) 
   and JavaScript (for functionality) are added on top of it.

3. **Hyperlink Integration:** HTML enables the use of hyperlinks, 
   connecting different web pages and resources, which forms the basis of the World Wide Web.

4. **Media Embedding:** HTML allows embedding of multimedia like images, audio, video, and interactive content.

5. **Semantic Markup:** By using semantic elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`),
   HTML improves accessibility and SEO by providing meaningful information about the page structure.

6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** HTML works across various devices and browsers,
   ensuring consistent content delivery.



In short, HTML is essential for creating the layout and content structure of web pages and is the first step in web development.
