Question 4: Discuss the role of semantic HTML.
Why is it important for accessibility and SEO? Provide examples of semantic elements.

Answer:  Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements which plays a crucial role in web development by providing meaningful structure to a webpage. It allows search engines and assistive technologies like screen readers to better understand the content and context of each element
on the page. This is important for accessibility and SEO because it enables search engines to crawl and index.
Unlike non-semantic elements like <div> or <span>, semantic elements clearly define their role in the document structure.

Importance of Semantic HTML

1) Improves Accessibility: By using semantic tags, screen readers can accurately interpret the page structure and navigate content more effectively, providing a better experience for users with visual impairments. For example, <nav> indicates navigation menus, and <header> signifies a page header, helping visually impaired users understand the context.

2) Enhances SEO : Search engines can readily identify the key sections of a page, like headers, navigation, and main content, which can positively impact search engine ranking by providing a clearer understanding of the page's organization and relevance to search queries. For instance, <article> or <section> tags help search engines index content more accurately, improving visibility in search results.

3) Improves Code Readability and Maintainability: When a screen reader encounters a <nav> tag, it will announce to the user that they are navigating to a new section of the page, allowing them to quickly jump to relevant content. This elements convey their purpose without needing comments or additional documentation.

4) Future-Proof and Standard-Compliant:  Semantic HTML adheres to web standards, ensuring compatibility with current and future technologies.
