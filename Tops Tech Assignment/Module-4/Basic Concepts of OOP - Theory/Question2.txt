Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to represent data 
and the methods that manipulate that data. OOP emphasizes code reusability, 
scalability, and easier maintenance.


Key Concepts of OOP:

Classes and Objects:

Class: A blueprint for creating objects, defining attributes and methods.

Object: An instance of a class with specific values for its attributes.
Encapsulation:


Bundling data and methods within a class and restricting access to protect object integrity.
Inheritance:

Mechanism that allows a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from a superclass, 
promoting code reusability.
Polymorphism:

Ability to present the same interface for different data types, 
achieved through method overriding and overloading.
Abstraction:

Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential features,
allowing focus on high-level interactions.
